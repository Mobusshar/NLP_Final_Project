# Semantic Similarity Analysis with NLP

Welcome to the final project repository for NLP! Dive into our intricate analysis of word pairs using a plethora of datasets. Uncover contextual nuances and compare how computational models stand up against human judgment in the realm of semantic similarity.


## About

This project aims to explore semantic relationships between various word pairs using datasets like MC, RG, and WSD353. Through detailed visualizations and metrics, we analyze the effectiveness of FastText embeddings and other NLP techniques in capturing the essence of human judgments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

## Usage

**Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mobusshar/NLP_Final_Project.git
cd NLP_Final_Project
```

This code will engage the datasets, run the analysis, and generate insightful visualizations.

## Datasets

We employ the following datasets for our analysis:

- **MC Dataset**: Delve into word pairs of varied semantic relationships.
- **RG Dataset**: Explore an extensive range of word pair spectrums.
- **WSD353 Dataset**: Engage in a deep dive across an extensive semantic landscape.

## Results

Navigate to the `results` directory to view generated visualizations and insights. Witness the side-by-side comparisons of model-generated similarity scores by human judgments.
